**Introduction** 

:newspaper: As of *January 2019*, a publication is underway related to the `Automation of the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) Workflow Using a Run Sequence Wizard`. 

:pushpin: This repository contains documents related to the work done at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/index.html) pharmaceutical company in the summer of 2018 as a Bioinformatics Intern at West Point, PA. ‚õîÔ∏è **Information excludes all proprietary information belonging to Merck & Co.** ‚õîÔ∏è

:pushpin: I specifically worked in the Merck Research Laboratories (MRL) :arrow_forward: Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism (PPDM) :arrow_forward: Discovery Bioanalytical (DBA) group. 

:pushpin: During my WONDERFUL time there in the summer, I was involved with two projects which are explained in `PDF` documents in this repository. A brief explanation of each `PDF` document is provided below. I also was able to learn and **experience first-hand** the process of pharmaceutical drug development.
