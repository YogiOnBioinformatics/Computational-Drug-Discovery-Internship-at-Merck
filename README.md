**Introduction** 

:newspaper: As of *January 2019*, a publication is underway related to the `Automation of the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) Workflow Using a Run Sequence Wizard`. 

This repository contains documents related to the work done at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/index.html) pharmaceutical company in the summer of 2018 as a Computational Drug Discovery Intern at West Point, PA. ‚õîÔ∏è **Information excludes all proprietary information belonging to Merck & Co.** ‚õîÔ∏è

I specifically worked in the Merck Research Laboratories (MRL) :arrow_forward: Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism (PPDM) :arrow_forward: Discovery Bioanalytical (DBA) group. 

During my WONDERFUL time there in the summer, I was involved with two projects which are explained in `PDF` documents in this repository. A brief explanation of each `PDF` document is provided below. I also was able to learn and **experience first-hand** the process of pharmaceutical drug development.

üìú`Automation of the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) Workflow Using a Run Sequence Wizard.pdf` 

This is the explanation of the main project I did over the summer at Merck in a :exclamation:VERY DETAILED:exclamation: manner. The beginning of the document has some main points for those that do not want to read through the whole document. 

üìú`Protein Drug-Target Scoring Python Script.pdf` 

Side project undertaken during Bioinformatics Internship at Merck that :exclamation: **led to novel drug targets that Merck is currently studying for creation of new therapeutics.** :exclamation:
