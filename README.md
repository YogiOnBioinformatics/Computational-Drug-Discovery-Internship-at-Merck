**Introduction** 

:page_facing_up:: As of *January 2019*, a publication is underway related to the `Automation of the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) Workflow`. 

This repository contains documents related to the work done at [Merck](https://www.merck.com/index.html) pharmaceutical company in the summer of 2018 as a Computational Drug Discovery Intern at West Point, PA. Information excludes all proprietary information belonging to Merck & Co. 

I specifically worked in the Merck Research Laboratories (MRL) :arrow_forward: Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism (PPDM) :arrow_forward: Discovery Bioanalytical (DBA) group. 

During my WONDERFUL time there in the summer, I was involved with two projects which are explained in `PDF` documents in this repository. A brief explanation of each `PDF` document is provided below.
